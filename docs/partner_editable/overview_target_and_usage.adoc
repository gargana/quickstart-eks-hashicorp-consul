This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying {partner-company-name}
{partner-product-short-name} on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) via {partner-company-name}
{partner-product-short-name}'s Helm chart.

{partner-company-name} {partner-product-short-name} is a product that centrally secures, stores and controls access to
tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys through a UI, CLI, or an HTTP API.

{partner-company-name} {partner-product-short-name}'s core use cases include:

* Service registry & health monitoring, to provide a real-time directory of all services with their health status;
* Network middleware automation, with service discovery for dynamic reconfiguration as services scale up, down or move;
* Zero trust network with service mesh, to secure service-to-service traffic with identity-based security policies and
encrypted traffic with Mutual-TLS.

This Quick Start is for service networking professionals and application developers who want to securely connect
services, monitor, and automate them. It's deployed via the
https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-helm[{partner-product-short-name} Helm chart],
which contains all of the resource definitions to install and configure {partner-product-short-name} inside of a
